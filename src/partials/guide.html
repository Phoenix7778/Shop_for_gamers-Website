          The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair
          of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.

          So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming
          headsets?

          Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming
          headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
          music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for
          gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great
          micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound
          experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
          headphones.
        </p>
        <p class="guide__text">
          However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
          have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic
          like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
        </p>
        <p class="guide__text">
          A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja,
          famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT
          990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while
          streaming his games.
        </p>
        <p class="guide__text">
          There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones
          setup for gaming.
        </p>
        <p class="guide__text">
          Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
          As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic
          itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic
          and headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and
          microphone quality.
